I haven't blogged in over a year, but I've been feeling the itch lately. Unfortunately, I was lazy with my last WordPress site and ended up letting my old blog's hosting lapse, which then meant that my old posts are gone as well. So this time, I'm hosting my blog on Github and running a simple Jekyll site instead. I'll probably play with the theme in the future, but for now, I'm content with the basic starter Jekyll theme.

The next post on this page will be the first "real" post of the blog. The topics will probably be WordPress or programming related, though forgive me if I swerve into other topics at times. My Poli Sci background occastionally whispers to me to encourage me to make political posts, but I'll try to keep that to a minimum.
