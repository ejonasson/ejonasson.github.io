_I've recently picked up Dungeon Mastering for a D&D Group recently, and wanted to share some of the things I've learned during this experience. I'm going to attempt to do an article after each session that explains something I think didn't go well, and how I (or any other DM) could potentially avoid this issue in the future._

_The game referenced below is a game of 4th Edition D&D, but many of the concepts could apply to other games as well._

Currently in the Dungeons and Dragons game I run, the players are attempting to clear out *Stoneclaw Keep*, an old fort that some goblins have taken over, in hopes of using the keep as their guild's base of operations in the future. This leads to a story that's fairly classic for D&D: the players open the door, the room contains some sort of set of baddies, and then the players clear out the baddies. Simple, right?

My challenge as the DM is to make each fight still feel exciting and unique, even though the setting for each battle in this Keep is fairly similar. I tried to do this by mixing up the types of encounters that players would run into - there was a large table surrounded by feasting goblins, a roaming patrol of hobgoblins, and an ambush in a supposedly unoccupied chapel.

While my players seemed to be happy with these encounters, there was one part I felt unhappy with myself: a general lack of movement or mobility for most of the encounters, by both the players and the monsters.

For example, here's an image of how the final encounter of the keep was laid out. In this situation, the PCs open the door to the Keep's throne room, and see the leader of the goblin band sitting on the stone throne, flanked by a couple of Goblin Hexers, with his guards flanking the staircase:

However, for much of the encounter, the players and goblins were bunched up like this:

![Goblin Keep Throne Room]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/dndMistakes/goblin_encounter_image_2.png)

In this image, the players are mostly crammed in the doorway of the encounter, with the Goblin Hexers(effectively the Spellcasters of the group) in the rear, and the players shoulder-to-shoulder with the walls and each other. Only after a couple of goblins were killed could anybody really break free - and at that point, the players were nearly in cleanup mode and most of the tension had dissolved.

This was a problem for me for a couple reasons:

1. In 4th Edition D&D, the primary "interesting" thing about goblins is that they can shift around a lot in combat. Their leader can order the subordinates to move around, and the individual grunts can shift in response to attacks missing them. As a result, it's easy to get surrounded by goblins if you're not careful.

2. One of our characters is a melee Ranger, and melee Rangers also want to get behind their opponents for combat advantage. But with her shoulder to the wall for the first half of the fight, that wasn't really an option for her.

Neither of these restrictions are explicitly bad, but it was problematic that the players were railroaded into this fighting position. If this had been a strategic decision by the players("Hey, let's have them come to us in the corridor so they're bottlenecked"), I would have been all for it. But since they basically walked in the door and were bum-rushed by goblins, it more or less happened by accident. That type of fight is not quite up to the standard I'd like to provide for my players.

I've started to think of this as the "Doorway Encounter," where the fight doesn't take place in the room itself, but largely remains stuck in the doorway. As a result, both the enemies and the players have limited choices as far as movement or tactics, and it makes any interesting mechanics within the room itself largely irrelevant. As such, one goal I have for future sessions is to try to allow fights to happen _in the room_ whenever possible, unless doing otherwise is a decision made by the players.

## The Causes of the Doorway Encounter

I think there are a few causes of these Doorway Encounters, which are largely preventable.

### Initiation of Combat

I've noticed each of these encounters seem to start in a similar fashion:

> You swing the the heavy stone door open, and see a large crowd of goblins before you. The leader sneers at you through golden teeth, and shouts "Intruders! I will enjoy feasting on your bones", and raises his hammer in challenge.

At which point, the players roll for initiative and combat begins.

In retrospect, I think there are a few problems with this setup. For one, it forces the encounter to begin the instant the door is open. There's no moment of uncertainty, where a player can choose to charge headlong at the foe, attempt some diplomacy, or otherwise interact with the enemy.

The players are not choosing when or how to attack, and have no opportunity to take control of the encounter. They may have guessed there was an encounter behind the door, but they had no way to anticipate what it was, to lay a trap, or do anything to mix up the playing field.

Of course, sometimes combat is supposed to be a surprise, and in those cases PCs shouldn't be given the opportunity to attempt to position themselves. But unless they're walking into a trap (or they take too long to do anything once they enter the room), they should at least get one reaction of some kind before rolling initiative.

**Lesson:** Give PCs a chance to take action when entering a new space

### Defining the Battlefield

For my current players, Dungeons and Dragons was not their first RPG. Their first RPGs were things like Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft. And while they have learned they can do things in this game that they couldn't do in most video games, I think those video-game-inspired conventions can still affect their behavior in subtle ways.

For example, let's look at the above encounter again:

![Goblin Keep Throne Room]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/dndMistakes/goblin_encounter_image_1.png)

If you were given this map, you could easily assume your only options were to progress into the room, or to flee the encounter entirely. A player could easily assume the grid placed in front of you defines the boundaries of the battlefield, and not think to much about what lies outside. But look at a slightly zoomed out version of the map:

![Goblin Keep Throne Room]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/dndMistakes/goblin_encounter_image_3.png)

Players have some more options here. For example, they could easily take cover behind one of the corners on the outside of the main gate. Or they could fall back through the hallways and try to stay out of range of the Goblin Hexers, and pick off the melee-range goblins as they pursued. Even in a fairly simple encounter like this, this extra context adds more options beyond "stand and fight", or "run away."

I don't know if the players would have chosen any of those options, but by placing only one room in front of them, I'm implicitly saying "These are the boundaries of this battle." But if I had zoomed out the map slightly, the players may have been inspired to use the whole of the Keep to their advantage. Whether or not they would choose to do so, I think providing small visual hints like that would give the players a lot more room to be creative.

**Lesson:** Give players more context for an encounter, so they have more opportunities to make decisions.

### Give Players a Goal (other than killing everybody)

I suspect that, when the only goal of an encounter is to clear the room, my players' instincts will be to play as cautiously as possible. That means that the players are unlikely to do anything that puts them at risk, or denies them a possible opportunity to attack. In 4th Edition terms, that means players will stay close together, avoid actions that could trigger attacks of opportunity, and avoid doing things like double-moving to a different target instead of attacking the enemy that's closest to them.

So in a future encounter, I think I want to put a time-sensitive goal in front of the player. This could provide a sense of urgency that forces the players to choose between their safe playstyles, and some additional reward or objective. It could be trying to stop a wizard from across the room from channeling a powerful spell, or a saving a friendly NPC that has a sword to his/her throat. I'm interested to see if that leads to different behavior in battle, and what types of risks my players will be willing to take.

**Lesson:** Give players a reason to not play it safe.

## Final Thoughts

Ultimately, I'm very happy with the group of players I've been playing with. Everything I mentioned above is in the interest of making encounters more fun and memorable for them. My goal is to make every encounter feel different than the ones that have come before. Sometimes that means coming up with inventive mechanics for a fight, or introducing new enemies that the players haven't fought before. But often, I think it just comes down to small details that give the opportunity for players to come up with their own solutions.

Hopefully some of these lessons will help me (and you) to make the fights in my next session a unique experience.
