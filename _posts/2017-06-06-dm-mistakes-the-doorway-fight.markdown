_I've recently picked up Dungeon Mastering for a D&D Group recently, and wanted to share some of the things I've learned during this experience. I'm going to attempt to do an article after each session that explains something I think didn't go well, and how I (or any other DM) could potentially avoid this issue in the future._

_The game referenced below is a game of 4th Edition D&D, but I think many of the concepts could apply to other games as well._

Currently in the Dungeons and Dragons game I run, the players are attempting to clear out *Stoneclaw Keep*, an old fort that some goblins have taken over, in hopes of using the keep as their guild's base of operations in the future. This leads to a story that's fairly classic for D&D: the players open the door, the room contains some sort of set of baddies, and then the players clear out the baddies. Simple, right?

My challenge as the DM is to try to make each fight still feel exciting and unique, even though the setting for each site is fairly similar. I tried to do this by mixing up the types of encounters that players would run into - there was a large table surrounded by feasting goblins, a roaming patrol of hobgoblins, and a planned ambush in a supposedly unoccupied room.

While my players seemed to be happy with these encounters, there was one part I felt unhappy with myself: a general lack of movement or mobility for most of the encounters, by both the players and the monsters.

For example, here's an image of how the final encounter of the keep was laid out. In this situation, the PCs open the door to the Keep's throne room, and see the leader of the goblin band sitting on the stone throne, flanked by a couple of goblin Shaman, with his guards flanking the staircase:

However, for much of the encounter, the players and goblins were bunched up like this:

In this image, the players are mostly crammed in the doorway of the encounter, with the goblin spellcasters in the rear, and the players shoulder-to-shoulder with the walls and each other. Only after a couple of goblins were killed could anybody really break free - and at least my experience, the players are in cleanup mode at that point anyways.

This was a problem for me for a couple reasons:

1. In 4th Edition D&D, the primary "interesting" thing about goblins is that they can shift around a lot in combat. Their leader can order the subordinates to move around, and the individual grunts can shift in response to attacks missing them. As a result, it's easy to get surrounded by goblins if you're not careful.

2. One of our characters is a melee ranger, and melee rangers also want to get behind their opponents for combat advantage. But with her shoulder to the wall for the first half of the fight, that wasn't really an option for her.


Neither of these things are explicitly bad, but it was problematic that the players were sort of pushed into this fighting position by accident. If this had been a strategic decision by the players("Hey, let's have them come to us in the corridor so they're bottlenecked"), I would have been all for it. But since they basically walked in the door and were bum-rushed by goblins, it sort of happened by accident. While I don't think it's happened enough so that these fights have become boring to my players, they're not quite up to the standard I'd like to provide for them.

## The Causes of the Doorway Encounter

I think there are a few causes of these "Doorway Encounters", which are largely preventable.

### Initiation of Combat 

I've noticed each of these encounters seem to start in a similar fashion:

> You swing the the heavy stone door open, and see a large crowd of goblins before you. The leader sneers at you through golden teeth, and shouts "Intruders! I will enjoy feasting on your bones", and raises his hammer in challenge.

At which point, the players roll for initiative and combat begins. 

In retrospect, I think there are a few problems with this setup. For one, it forces the encounter to begin the instant the door is open. There's no moment of uncertainty, where a player can choose to charge headlong at the foe, attempt some diplomacy, or otherwise interact with the enemy.

The players are not choosing when or how to attack, and have no opportunity to take control of the encounter. They may have guessed there was a baddie behind the door, but they had no way to anticipate what it was, to lay a trap, or do anything to mix up the playing field. 

Of course, sometimes combat is supposed to be a surprise, and PCs shouldn't be given the opportunity to position themselves. But unless they're walking into a trap (or they take too long to do anything once they enter the room), they should get to decide when combat begins.

**Lesson:** Give PCs a chance to take action when entering a new space

### Defining the Battlefield

For my current players, Dungeons and Dragons was not their first RPG. Their first RPGs were things like Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft. And while they have learned they can do things in this game that they couldn't do in most video games, it's easy for some of those conventions to alter their behavior in subtle ways.

For example, let's look at the above encounter again:

If you were given this map, you could easily assume your only options were to progress into the room, or to flee the encounter entirely. But look at the full keep map when it's zoomed out:

Players have a lot more options here. For example, they could easily take cover behind one of the corners on the outside of the main gate. They could even try to lure the enemies out of this room, and see if they can get them to give chase into another hallway or chamber, where the characters could more easily surround the enemy, or more easily target the less durable spellcasters.

I don't know if the players would have chosen any of those options, but by placing only one room in front of them, I'm implicitly saying "These are the boundaries of this battle." But if I'd zoomed out the map a little bit, and drawn them something like this:

IMAGE

It's possible they would have been inspired to use the whole of the Keep to their advantage. Whether they would do it or not, I think providing small visual hints like that would give the players a lot more room to be creative.

**Lesson:** Give players more context for an encounter, so they have more opportunities to make decisions.

### Give Players a Goal (other than killing everybody)

This is something I'd like to experiment with in a future encounter. I think, when the only goal of an encounter is to clear the room, the players will inherently play as cautiously as possible. They're not under any sort of time constraint, and generally killing one monster is about as good as killing any other.

That means that the players are unlikely to do anything that puts them at risk, or denies them a possible opportunity to attack. In 4th Edition terms, that means players will avoid giving attacks of opportunity to maneuver faster, and they'll avoid doing things like double-moving to a different target instead of attacking the enemy that's closest to them.

So in a future encounter, I think I want to put a time-sensitive goal in front of the player, that forces them to not play it safe, or suffer the consequences. It could be trying to stop a wizard from across the room from channeling a powerful spell, or a friendly NPC that has a sword to his/her throat. I'm interested to see if that leads to different behavior in battle, and what types of risks my players will be willing to take. 

**Lesson:** Give players a reason to not play it safe.

## Final Thoughts

Ultimately, I'm very happy with the group of players I've been playing with. Everything I mentioned above is in the interest of making encounters more fun and memorable for them. Hopefully some of these lessons will help me (and you) to make the fights in my next session a unique experience.
